# testpk232
Program to help troubleshoot AX25 and KISS problems

I purchased an AEA Packrat back in the 1990s. At that time, I was running Red Hat 7 on a 386 PC. After spending days trying to get the AX25 to work on linux, I finally gave up. The Packrat worked just fine with my logging software on Windows 95, so I let it slide. Now that I am retired and have more free time, I decided that it was time to get this think working the way it was intended to (I.e., on linux). I naively thought that it must have been some linux bug and surely it would be corrected by now. 

Just like before, in normal "converse" mode, it worked just fine. But, when KISS is turned on, the PK232 went silent. I tried a lot of different things (thus the very messy condition of the code), but finally figured out that the Packrat expected RTS to be high when in KISS mode. (even though the KISS specification specifically states that there should be no flow control, hardware or software). I couldn't have done it without the help of this little program.

With all of the hurt that this caused me, I figured I'd post this out there just in case some other poor fool is going through similar anguish. It should work with any TNC that supports KISS.

Some of the code is semi-lifted from the linux mkiss driver (I wanted to make sure that it was de-encapsulating the PK232â€™s KISS data properly). So, those subroutines my require a GPL license. But, the rest is DWTFYWWI. 

Note that the code uses the appf2 library to do some housekeeping tasks. You can find a copy of the library here :  

What I found that the most useful feature, was the hex/ascii/shifted ascii dump mode. It's similar to the "TRACE" output on the PK232.

Anyway, folks... have fun!
